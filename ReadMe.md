# ðŸªµ Serilog & SEQ Wrapper 

This package is useful in cases where the project is already existing and we don't want refactor each and every file to use serilog instead of MEL logger
- Sets up structure logging by replacing normal Microsoft Extensions Logging (MEL) with Serilog.
- Enriches the log context with the Application Name. Useful when working locally with multiple services.
- Writes logs to Applications Insights 
- Writes logs local SEQ instance.
